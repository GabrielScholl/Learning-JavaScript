# Learning-JavaScript
I've already made a project involving JavaScript, but recently I asked myself: "How much JavaScript do I actually know?". The answer to that is I learned only what was necessary for the project, so something, but not everything. This repository aims to be a practice suite for my JavaScript skills and the concepts I'm currently learning.
